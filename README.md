# Rental Bike Share Prediction 🚴

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole
process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through
these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs
around the world which is composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists
great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and
health issues. Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the
characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the
research.
The goal here is to build an end-to-end regression task. Here the user will provide the
data and the result will be given by the best performing hyper tuned Machine Learning
model

## Overview 📜

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

  
## DataSet 📊

To Know more about data and its characterstics you can download dataset form https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset 



  
## Installation 🗄️

The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://github.com/Priyam-Trivedi/ebike_count_prediction/tree/master) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement
### Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/dKmlpqX.png)](https://heroku.com)

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

### AWS(Amazon Web Services)
Login or signup with free tier in order to create virtual amchine(EC2 instance) for free. 
Note:- In free trier virtual Machine will only give free service for 720hr almost a month after that you will be charged , so use carefully. I usally stop instance when not need to avoid extra charge so it may happen that deployment link for AWS might not work
