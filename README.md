# Rental Bike Share Prediction 🚴

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole
process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through
these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs
around the world which is composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists
great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and
health issues. Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the
characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the
research.
The goal here is to build an end-to-end regression task. Here the user will provide the
data and the result will be given by the best performing hyper tuned Machine Learning
model
